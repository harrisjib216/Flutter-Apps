# Dart vs JavaScript

IMHO, I belive that Dart is a better language for application development than JavaScript.

Although I love JavaScript, Dart proves to be more performant, consistent, and maintainable than
JavaScript and TypeScript.

Occassionally, I will write tests to benchmark the two languages and record their results.
